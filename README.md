# JPACRUDProject2

## Overview
The JPALandDevelopment project is a Java-based web application that leverages the Java Persistence API (JPA) within a Spring MVC framework to manage a MySQL database for tracking land acquisitions. This application provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations through a user-friendly web interface, tailored for managing and tracking land development projects.

## Description
JPALandDevelopment is designed to enable users to interact with a land acquisition database via intuitive web-based CRUD operations. The application demonstrates the integration of JPA with Spring MVC, allowing for efficient manipulation and management of data within a MySQL database.

This database is structured to record details about land parcels, including geographic location, zoning status, pricing, and transaction dates. This setup aids in overseeing the acquisition and development process from the initial purchase through to the development stage.

### Key Features
- **Create**: Users can add new land records into the database.
- **Read**: Allows for detailed viewing of specific land records, providing insights into various aspects of each parcel.
- **Update**: Users can update existing records to reflect changes in information or status.
- **Delete**: Users can remove records that are no longer relevant or required.
- **Web Interface**: Designed for ease of use, ensuring that users can efficiently manage and track land acquisition details.

### Technologies Used
- **Java**: Primary programming language.
- **Spring MVC**: Framework used for creating scalable and robust web applications.
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: Manages relational data in Java applications.
- **MySQL**: Database system used for storing and managing the application's data.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for creating and styling the web interface.
- **Bootstrap**: Framework for designing responsive and mobile-first web pages.
- **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**: Utilized to generate dynamic web content by integrating server-side Java code with HTML, specifically for managing user interactions and data presentation in the web application.
- **Gradle**: Build tool for automating the build process and managing dependencies.
- **Git/GitHub**: Used for version control and hosting the project repository.
- **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**: Spring Tool Suite 4 for enhanced development efficiency.

## Lessons Learned
- **Integration of JPA and Spring MVC**: Mastery in configuring and utilizing JPA within the Spring MVC framework.
- **Effective CRUD Implementation**: Deepening understanding of CRUD operations' implementation in web applications.
- **Advanced Database Management**: Enhanced skills in designing a database schema that effectively supports the management of land acquisition projects.
- **User Interface Design**: Developed experience in crafting user interfaces that are straightforward and accessible for various user demographics.
- **Application Deployment**: Gained insights into deploying a full-stack application to a cloud environment (AWS), including setup for both the application and its database.

## Deployment
The application is hosted on AWS, demonstrating the deployment of a Spring MVC and JPA integrated web application in a cloud environment. This setup ensures the application is accessible from anywhere and manages land development processes efficiently.
